Sertify
--------

Badges are add-ons to traditional degree transcripts
They are pre-verified
Easily organise all your experiences 
Each badge is backed by evidence
As an issuer we can create a criteria based on what the user earns the badge
According to University Professional Continuing Education Association (UPCEA) one in every five institutes issued digital badges last year in US
Once a student is out of school/college they don't have a formal way to represent 
Institutes can create outcome-based credentials
Since these badges are open and of international standard it makes easy for employers to look for the right candidate
We are creating a whole community/eco-system to provide high-quality credentials that recognize lifelong learning.
With Sertify individuals own there own achievements
